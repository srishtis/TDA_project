# TDA_project
This project was done as a part of the coursework for the course Computational Topology at Duke University. 

For this project we used the LEGO dataset. We altered the Rebrickable dataset downloaded from [here](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) to build the prototypes. The steps to do this have been covered in the final report (found in the Reports folder). This dataset has images of LEGO parts across various categories like figures, bricks, tiles etc. 

In this project we tried to extract conventional features from an image like edges, corners, entropy, tubeness etc. along with topological features like persistence entropy, amplitudes etc. We then used all these features to build several classification models that would categorize these LEGO parts into modified categories (see final report for how we created these modified categories). We used the model results to evaluate if the addition of topological features improves the model performance and also the feature importance of all the features.
